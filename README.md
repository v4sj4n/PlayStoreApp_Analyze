# Google Play Store Apps basic dataset analyze

In this Jupyter Notebook I have some simple analyzations of this dataset that can be found in this link [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps), if you don't want to download the dataset, don't worry I have included a sample dataset in the repo

### Here is what I analyzed in the dataset
1. Find the app with the highest rating count and the app with the lowest rating count.
2. Calculate the average rating for each category of apps and identify the category with the highest average rating.
3. Sort the dataset by the number of installs in descending order and select the top 10 apps with the most installs.
4. Calculate the percentage of apps that are free versus paid.
5. Identify the app with the longest time since its last update and calculate the time difference between the last update and the release date for that app.
